    <h1>The Beauty of Tahitian Dance</h1>

    <h2>A few facts about tahitian dance</h2>

    <img src="tahitianphoto.jpg" width="400">

    <p>Ori Tahiti, which is the literal translation for “Tahitian dance”, is an original artistic expression rooted in
        ancient traditions, from which we ignore almost everything.
        Ori Tahiti by Joelle. Originally, Ori Tahiti was the art movement of a civilization that depended solely on oral tradition.
        The only element of this art that has survived centuries of turbulent history is the direct and intimate link
        between oral language and dance movement.
        Because of this correlation, the foundation of Tahitian dance remains today a direct link between the Tahitian
        language and choreographic art.
        This rich history is not what the audience remembers and rather they tend to focus on the characteristic
        movements of the dance, the costumes, the music, the percussions, and the joy of dancing.

        <ol>
            <li>Tahiti is made up of 118 islands and atolls spread out over five archipelagos. The whole archipelago spans 4.000.000 square km, which is the equivalent size of Europe.</li>

            <li>The word tattoo originated in French Polynesia.  Tattoos have long been considered signs of beauty in Polynesian culture, and in ancient times were ceremoniously applied to the body when reaching adolescence. The English word ‘tattoo’ comes from the Tahitian word ‘tatau’.</li>
